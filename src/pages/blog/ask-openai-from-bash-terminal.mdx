Inspired by [this article by Norah Sakal](https://norahsakal.com/blog/ask-gpt3-programming-questions-in-terminal) on asking OpenAI questions from the terminal using python.

I often find myself searching for the correct syntax for a command line tool or trying to remember the name of a specific flag. Instead of going to ChatGPT or asking GitHub Copilot, I wanted to see if I could get a quick answer from OpenAI directly in my terminal.

Meet `ask`, a bash command line program that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model to answer your questions right in the terminal. This small program not only sends your question to OpenAI, but also the output of `pwd` and `ls -al` to provide additional context for your question.

## Instructions
You can setup `ask` by adding the following lines in your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export OPEN_AI_API_KEY="myopenaiapikey"
alias ask='ruby ~/ask/ask.rb'
```

After that, run source ~/.bashrc to reload your shell. Remember to replace "myopenaiapikey" with your actual OpenAI API key. The ask.rb script should be located in the ask folder in your home directory.

## Usage
To use ask, simply type ask followed by your question in quotes:

```bash
ask "How do I extract my discord file?"
```

Let's say you have a discord.tar.gz file in your current directory and you don't know how to extract it. Here's how ask can help:

```bash
matt@ubuntu-desktop:~$ ls
ask  Desktop  discord.tar.gz  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  snap  Templates  Videos  working
matt@ubuntu-desktop:~$ ask "How do I extract my discord file?"
You can extract your discord file using the following command:

tar -xvf discord.tar.gz

This will extract the contents of the `discord.tar.gz` file in the current directory.
```

As you can see, ask not only gave the correct command to extract a tar.gz file, but it also used the correct filename from the context provided.

Currently, `ask` is configured to use the gpt-3.5-turbo model, but you can change it to gpt-4 in the ask.rb script if you prefer. The gpt-3.5-turbo model is generally sufficient for command line questions and provides cost savings.
