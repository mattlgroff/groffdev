UPDATE 2/4/2023 - I have a new blogpost for a much better method of running a GraphQL server with Bun [here with Apollo Server](https://groff.dev/bun-apollo-server/)

This is my first post on my new blog, how exciting!

Today, I was trying to find an example of how to make a GraphQL server with Bun, but I couldn't find one. I decided to create one instead.

You can read all about Bun here [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/).

Bun has a lot of the Node API built in, but it provides its own, faster, HTTP server. This causes incompatibilities with the traditional methods I use to create a GraphQL server (Apollo Server or ExpressJS). Thankfully, [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono) is compatible with Bun. It claims to be "a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework for Cloudflare Workers, Deno, Bun, and others."

Additionally, luck would have it, there is a new package for [GraphQL Server with Hono](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@honojs/graphql-server) which we can utilize to get a GraphQL server up and running. It was build as a fork of graphql-express, and it depends on the [GraphQL.js package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql) to work.

The GraphQL.js package does not fully support Bun at this time, but we only need one part of it in order to get this server to work, the `buildSchema` function.

Now to get started:

- Install Bun:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

- Create a new project. I personally did `npm init` to create a `package.json` file.

```bash
mkdir bun-graphql
cd bun-graphql
npm init
```

- We'll need a few dependencies:

```bash
bun add graphql
bun add hono
bun add @honojs/graphql-server
```

- Create an index.js file and add the following code:

```javascript
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { graphqlServer } from '@honojs/graphql-server'
import { buildSchema } from 'graphql/utilities/buildASTSchema.js'

// Initialize Hono
export const app = new Hono()

// Builds schema from a string
const schema = buildSchema(`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`)

// Resolvers
const rootResolver = (ctx) => {
  return {
    hello: () => 'Hello Hono!',
  }
}

// Hono.js GraphQL Server
app.use(
  '/graphql',
  graphqlServer({
    schema,
    rootResolver,
  })
)

// Set the default port to 3000, or use the PORT environment variable
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000

console.log(`Hono ðŸ¥Ÿ GraphQL Server Listening on port ${port}`)

export default {
  port,
  fetch: app.fetch,
}
```

This is based off the example file from Hono's GraphQL Server package, but tweaked to match Hono's Bun example.

It's important to import `buildSchema` directly from `''graphql/utilities/buildASTSchema.js'`, otherwise your app will fail because the GraphQL.js library isn't fully Bun compatible, but this essential function is.

- Run the server:

```bash
bun index.js
```

You won't see any logs in the console, but you should see a GraphQL server running if you query the endpoint. `http://localhost:3000/graphql`

- Let's deploy this app using a Dockerfile. Create a new file called `Dockerfile` and add the following code:

```
FROM jarredsumner/bun:0.5.1
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package.json
COPY bun.lockb bun.lockb
RUN bun install
COPY index.js index.js
EXPOSE 3000
ENTRYPOINT ["bun", "index.js"]
```

You can test the Dockerfile locally if you have Docker installed by running the following command:

```bash
docker build -t bun-graphql .

docker run -p 3000:3000 bun-graphql
```

- Commit and push up the code to a new repository. I suggest adding `node_modules/` to the `.gitignore` file.

- I deployed using [Render](https://render.com/), but there are tons of options to deploy an application in a Docker Container.

I selected "New +" and then selected "Web Service". Once I connected my repository to the service, it detected my Dockerfile and was building and deploying in minutes.

To test that deployment works, run the same `hello` query against the GraphQL server on the newly deployed endpoint.

Congrats, if everything worked you have a GraphQL server running on Bun in the cloud!

You can find the source code for my example GraphQL Server w/ Bun on GitHub [here](https://github.com/mattlgroff/bun-graphql). The code is going to look a bit different than the example here in this blog because I added GraphQL Playground and I'm reading my schema from a `graphql.schema` file.
